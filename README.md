# **Soundprints: Audio Fingerprinting App**

Soundprints is a Shazam-like app for identifying audio files (songs, vocals, or music) using spectrogram-based fingerprinting. This application supports audio mixing with similarity analysis, enabling efficient audio recognition from a pre-saved database.

## **Features**

### **Core Features**
1. **Audio Fingerprinting**:
   - Generate spectrograms for audio files (songs, music, and vocals) using the first 30 seconds of each track.
   - Extract features (spectral, tonal, and temporal) and create perceptual hashes for efficient audio recognition.

2. **Similarity Analysis**:
   - Compare a given audio file with the database.
   - Display similarity scores for each match in a clean table.
   - Sort results by similarity index.

3. **Audio Mixing**:
   - Combine two audio files with adjustable weight sliders.
   - Treat the mixed file as a new entry for similarity analysis.

4. **Efficient Data Handling**:
   - Automatically generates spectrograms, features, and fingerprints upon the first run.
   - Reuses generated files in subsequent runs to save time.

5. **Database Structure**:
   - Each song is stored in its own folder containing up to three audio files: `song.wav`, `vocals.wav`, and `instruments.wav`. 
   - The app can process any subset of these files, not requiring all three for a song.

6. **Future Scalability**:
   - Currently, the database is saved locally as folders within the project.
   - Future enhancements include moving the database to a server for real-time performance, like the real Shazam app.

## **Scenarios**

### **1. Identify an Audio File**
Upload an audio file (song, vocals, or music), and the app generates its fingerprint. The **Similarity Index Table** displays the closest matches from the database with similarity percentages and song details.

### **2. Audio Mixing and Recognition**
Use the **Weighted Blender** to combine two audio files. The app calculates a new fingerprint for the mixed audio and determines the most similar files in the database. Below is an example of mixing "FE!N vocals" with "Please Please Please song":

- **Similarity Index Table**:
  - Displays similarity scores for all database entries.
- **Recognized Song**:
  - Displays the most likely match for the mixed audio.

    "812dea55aa55aa57",
}
```

### **Features Explained**

1. **Spectral Features**:
   - **Spectral Centroid Mean**: Represents the center of gravity of the spectrum, indicating where the energy is concentrated.
   - **Spectral Bandwidth Mean**: Measures the width of the spectrum, showing how spread out the frequencies are.
   - **Spectral Contrast Mean**: Captures the difference in amplitudes between peaks and valleys in the spectrum, useful for identifying timbre.
   - **Spectral Rolloff Mean**: The frequency below which a specific percentage (e.g., 85%) of the spectral energy is concentrated.

2. **Tonal Features**:
   - **Tonnetz Mean**: Quantifies the tonal stability and harmonic content of the audio using tonal centroid features.

3. **Temporal Features**:
   - **Zero Crossing Rate Mean**: Measures how frequently the audio signal changes its sign, often used to distinguish between percussive and tonal sounds.

4. **MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**:
   - Capture the shape of the audio spectrum by breaking it down into a series of coefficients (e.g., `mfcc_0_mean`, `mfcc_1_mean`).
   - Essential for identifying unique audio characteristics like pitch, tone, and rhythm.

5. **Perceptual Hashing**:
   - Converts extracted features into compact hash strings for efficient comparison and matching.
   - Ensures robust recognition even when audio has slight variations.

## **How to Run the Project**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YassienTawfikk/Soundprints.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Soundprints
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
